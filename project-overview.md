# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Diamond Marketplace

Description: A web application that simulates a luxurious online diamond marketplace. Users can browse diamonds, view detailed information, and even "try on" rings virtually (all mocked). This project provides a realistic e-commerce experience for showcasing diamonds.

Features:

*   Diamond Listings: Beautifully displayed with high-quality images and detailed specifications (cut, carat, clarity, color).
*   Search and Filtering: Allow users to filter diamonds based on various criteria (price, carat, shape, etc.).
*   "Virtual Try-On": A feature that allows users to visualize how a diamond ring would look on their hand (using pre-made images and simple overlays).
*   Mock Shopping Cart and Checkout: Simulate the process of adding items to a cart and completing a purchase.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
